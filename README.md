<h2>Branden Dane: Full Stack Developer & Designer</h2>
<h5>Rebuilding my portfolio website for the millionth time.</h5><br>
<h2>What's new?</h2><br>
<h4>==> Built using ThreeJS</h4><br>
<h4>==> Blog incorporation, via Wordpress CMS</h4><br>
<h4>==> "Nuketown" aka an area for random ideas and what have you's. Expect this to just always be broken.</h4><br>
<h4>==> Connecting with Adobe's Creatie Cloud. I am trying to render all I can via CSS3D renderer, but still as an effective fall back I am including a portfolio hosted in Creative CLoud. I pay for it. Might as well use it for something.</h4><br>
<h2>TODO:</h2><br>
<h4>==> Convert to strictly serve via NodeJS (currently Apache)</h4><br>
<h4>==> Create awesome tutorials covering aspects of Design and Development, not just for the web but other applications as well such as After Effects.</h4><br>
<h4>==> Give this Github page some well needed love.</h4><br>
