Branden Dane: Web Developer & Designer

Rebuilding my portfolio website for the millionth time. 



What's new?

==> Built using ThreeJS
==> Blog incorporation, via Wordpress CMS
==> "Nuketown" aka an area for random ideas and what have you's. Expect this to just always be broken.
==> Connecting with Adobe's Creatie Cloud. I am trying to render all I can via CSS3D renderer, but still as an effective fall back I am including a portfolio hosted in Creative CLoud. I pay for it. Might as well use it for something.


TODO:

==> Convert to strictly serve via NodeJS (currently Apache)
==> Create awesome tutorials covering aspects of Design and Development, not just for the web but other applications as well such as After Effects.
